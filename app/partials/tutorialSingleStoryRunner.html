                    Single Story Runner is commonly used during the specification and development of some story.
                    After scenarios are written, developers should use the BDD in the TDD fashion:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Run scenarios and confirm that at least one of the failed or has pending steps</li>
                        <li>Implement the first one that failed or has pending steps</li>
                        <li>Run scenarios and confirm that the previous failed or with pending steps is working</li>
                        <li>Refactor</li>
                        <li>Repeat</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Run Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once inside an story, it can be run by clicking the "Run Story" button.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Run Story parameters dialog</h3>
                    <p>
                        "Run Story" action brings the story runner dialog that can be used to set required parameters.
                        For example, browser type and size can be specified in the story runner dialog.
                        To proceed and run the specified story using parameters set in this dialog, click the "Run Story" button.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Run Story outcome</h3>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Run Story execution status</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once the story run starts, progress bar will appear in the top right corner of the screen.
                            After the story run is finished, progress bar changes its status to successful or failed depending on the outcome.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Pending steps</h4>
                        <p>
                            If story that was run contains pending steps, they will be listed inside the story run outcome section.
                            To create the implementation of an pending step, please click on the corresponding link.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reports</h4>
                        <p>
                            Detailed report of the execution of all scenarios is provided as well.
                            If there are pending or failed steps, they are marked appropriately.
                        </p>
