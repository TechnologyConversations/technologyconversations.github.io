            TechnologyConversations.com is the result of after-the-office-hours talks between Viktor Farcic and Jordi
            Falguera.
            We would go to a bar or a pub, order a drink and some "tapas" and discuss.
            Those discussions could be anything from frustration regarding some work decision we had no control of,
            discussion about the latest article or blog post we read and, more than anything, planning of our next steps
            in the continuous struggle to improve processes in our own company.
            Many successful (and some failed) improvements were implemented in our company as a result of those
            conversations.
            Our objective was to make a big, international and well established company as efficient, lean and modern as
            possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the long time we kept those discussions for ourselves until, near the end of 2013, we decided to share
            our "discussions" with the world outside the close corporate environment.
            Thus, TechnologyConversations.com site was born.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of our big subjects in the conversations was Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and ways to implement it
            in a company as big as the one we worked for at that time.
            BDD Assistant is the result of best-practices we found, discovered, modified or invented.
