                        <p>
                            If the BDD story form is valid, data can be permanently saved on the server.
                            In case of a new story, new file is created.
                            Otherwise, the contents of the existing story are overwritten with the modified version.
                            To save the story, click the "Save" button.
                            If saving is not allowed (i.e. invalid story), the button is disabled.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Revert changes</h3>
                        <p>
                            Any change made to the BDD story can be reverted to the version created on the last save.
                            To revert the BDD story, click the "Revert Changes" button.
                            This operation cannot be undone.
                            If there were no changes in the BDD story, the button is disabled.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Delete</h3>
                        <p>
                            Any BDD story can be deleted.
                            This operation cannot be undone.
                            If the BDD story was not previously saved in the server, the button is disabled.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Any BDD story can be renamed by changing the name and saving changes.
                        </p>
